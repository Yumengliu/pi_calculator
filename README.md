# PI Calculator

## How to Run Locally

You should have nodejs installed locally. 

Clone the project to your local folder, then run the following commands:

```
pi_calculator/backend
npm install
node app.js
```

Go to `localhost:8999` to play!

## Notes

The React frontend has already been built into static files and copied into `backend/build` folder, if you would like to rebuild the frontend code, just run `deploy.sh` in `pi-frontend` folder.

## Reference

* The frontend was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
* [React Vis](https://github.com/uber/react-vis) for data visualization.
